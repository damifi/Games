    1. setInterval(function(), milliseconds): calls the function() every milliseconds until clearInterval() is called

    2. addEventListener(type, function): every time the event of type happens, the function is called

    3. document.querySelector(selector) and document.querySelectorAll(selector) is used to select the first or all elements
    within the document(html file) that match the specified selector. Example: document.querySelector('.square') returns
    the first element of class (.) square from the html file. IDs etc are retrieved by '#id'.

    4. classList.add adds a class, classList.remove removes a class from the classlist of an element

    5. => acts like a function, a => { do something with a} represents a function that takes a parameter 'a' and the function
    consists of the block in {}
