HTML: 

1. tags:
    div: used to divide a HTML file into sections, acts as a container for elements and can be styled with css and js with class or id attribute
    span: similar to div but is an inline element
    button: clickable button


Javascript
0. General:
    1. class tags allow to pick specific classes later in javascript


2. Whac-a-mole:
    1. setInterval(function(), milliseconds): calls the function() every milliseconds until clearInterval() is called

    2. addEventListener(type, function): every time the event of type happens, the function is called

    3. document.querySelector(selector) and document.querySelectorAll(selector) is used to select the first or all elements
    within the document(html file) that match the specified selector. Example: document.querySelector('.square') returns
    the first element of class (.) square from the html file. IDs etc are retrieved by '#id'.

    4. classList.add adds a class, classList.remove removes a class from the classlist of an element

    5. => acts like a function, a => { do something with a} represents a function that takes a parameter 'a' and the function
    consists of the block in {} 

3. Connect Four
    1. classList.contains checks if the class list contains an element


4. Snake
    1. pop() removes the last element of an array and returns it

    2. unshift() adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array and returns the lenth of the array
